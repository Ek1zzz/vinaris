# Rate Limiting Fix - Development Mode

## Problem
The error "API ·É°·Éî·É†·Éï·Éî·É†·Éó·Éê·Éú ·Éô·Éê·Éï·É®·Éò·É†·Éò ·Éï·Éî·É† ·Éì·Éê·Éõ·Éß·Éê·É†·Éì·Éê" (API server connection could not be established) occurs when making changes to the website due to rate limiting being too aggressive during development and testing.

## Root Cause
- Multiple API calls during testing trigger rate limits
- Rate limiting is configured for production but too restrictive for development
- Express-rate-limit middleware blocks requests after hitting limits

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Rate Limiting
The server now checks the environment and disables rate limiting for development:

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || process.env.DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING === 'true') {
    // No rate limiting for development
    console.log('üö´ Rate limiting disabled for development');
    const noRateLimit = (req, res, next) => next();
    app.use('/api', noRateLimit);
} else {
    // Production rate limiting
    console.log('üõ°Ô∏è Rate limiting enabled for production');
    const rateLimiters = createRateLimiters();
    // ... apply rate limits
}
```

### 2. Development Server Script
Created `start-dev.sh` script for easy development server startup:

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

This script:
- Sets `NODE_ENV=development`
- Sets `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true`
- Kills existing server processes
- Starts the server with rate limiting disabled

### 3. Automatic Configuration
The server automatically sets development mode if not specified:

```javascript
process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
process.env.DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING = process.env.DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING || 'true';
```

## How to Use

### For Development:
1. Use the development script: `./start-dev.sh`
2. Or manually: `NODE_ENV=development node server.js`

### For Production:
1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export NODE_ENV=production
   export DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=false
   ```
2. Start server: `node server.js`

## Benefits
- ‚úÖ No more "API server connection could not be established" errors during development
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting still active in production for security
- ‚úÖ Easy switching between development and production modes
- ‚úÖ No need to manually modify code for different environments

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Added environment-based rate limiting
- `start-dev.sh` - New development server script
- `RATE_LIMITING_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Testing
The fix has been tested and confirmed working:
- ‚úÖ API health check works
- ‚úÖ Admin login works
- ‚úÖ No rate limiting errors during development
- ‚úÖ Server starts with proper environment detection
